# kaggle-whaleID
A Jupyter notebook prototyping a conv-net trained to identify species of whales based on pictures of their tails (Network structure is adapted from the second example found in [this article](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html)). Created for [this Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whale-categorization-playground).
